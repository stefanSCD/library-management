   - Interactive legend showing book titles and authors

2. **Borrowing Trends Analysis (Line Chart)**

     - Monthly (last 12 months)
   - Helps identify peak borrowing periods
   - Useful for staff scheduling and inventory management

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Windows 10 or later
- [.NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.15-windows-x64-installer?cid=getdotnetcore)
- [SQL Server LocalDB 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb) (included with Visual Studio 2022)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (for development only)

### Database Configuration

The application uses SQL Server LocalDB with automatic database initialization. The database file (`LibraryDB.mdf`) is automatically created in your local AppData folder when you first run the application.

**Note**: SQL Server LocalDB is typically installed with Visual Studio 2022. If you get a database connection error, you may need to install SQL Server LocalDB separately.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stefanSCD/library-management.git

2. **Run the LibraryManagement.sln file and start the program**
      OR
   **Use LibraryManagement.exe from LibraryManagement\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\LibraryManagement.exe**
